Evolution is a subject known to us for roughly 160 years, and in that time we have been viewing it completely wrong. I'm not saying all of us see it wrong, of the experts I'm sure there are a fair number, but I don't hold the number even high for them. But the public, I'm sure, almost completely, has it completely the opposite of the way it is. And it goes back all the way to the beginning. Now, I don't blame Charles Darwin for getting a few things about the process inaccurate. I do feel, however, like today's scientists should have modified the theories language to improve how people understand things. I don't think I have new information about the theory of evolution. All I'm offering is a novel interpretation that I don't think you've considered, and when you do it will make way more sense than what you've conventionally heard. It might not seem like a big deal, but there are a few implications from all of this that reach pretty far. We'll get to all that.


I wrote about evolution in my "extraterrestrial life" piece, but I thought this subject deserved it's own piece.  So here we are talking about evolution in all it's glory. And we'll get into a few other topics since we have the space. Always more to say. It's a deep enough subject for an evolutionary biologist with enough of a specialty to fill volumes, but we won't need to do that here to cover what I think is important. In fact I think evolution is a rather simple topic and can truly be fully understood without much detailed chemistry or genetics as the evolutionary biologists would generally have you believe. I think what they are doing is over analyzing and over doing chemical and genetic scientific studies and drawing abstract results that they will never be able to pin down so that their study ultimately comes to nothing but a lot of fancy chemistry, genetics, and statistics. The process of evolution is a macro process, and these scientists are attempting to apply micro scientific theories to the progression of chemicals and genes, and it simply doesn't make any sense. So beyond all the wasted evolutionary chemical and genetic research that goes on everyday, evolution as a macro process discussed in public by the experts and understood by the public (and understood by the experts for all I know), there remains a blinding misconception.  


The misconception about evolution is of a quality you've probably never even associated with it at all. Processes in general: actions, processes, mechanisms, etc. are qualified as either "active," where it requires an agent or actor, or "passive," where it operates automatically, by superseding laws, like those of physics. An example of an active process is hitting a home run, it requires a player to hit the ball (note, the agent doesn't have to be human). If it's passive, then the process is automatic, and is governed by some other set of forces, like gravity, a planet moving in its orbit is an example of a passive process.


The theory of evolution has been quoted in this simple form since its inception: "evolution by natural selection." This means that organisms with traits that give them an advantage in the environment survive, thus pass on their genes to subsequent generations, which is that they are then said to have undergone "natural selection." Now, I phrased that very forgivingly. It doesn't fully make my point about the misconception, but the term "natural selection" is still enough to mean "evolution is an active process" to people. It sounds like there is something selecting organisms for survival if their traits have an advantage. There's a more common way evolutionary biologist's have put it to the public in many forums that make it sound even more active, they abbreviate it so egregiously they may be single handedly responsibly for an entire religious movement that has little sight of going away anytime soon(more on this to come). They say something like "organisms with traits that give them an advantage in the environment are "selected" for survival" and I'll point it out here because it's important: it sounds as if something or someone is doing the selecting. This is even worse, it's more common, and it makes it sound even more active. The sentence is literally in the active voice. the  previous form, at least the sentence was in the passive voice. But either way you cut it, the use of the word, "selection," or "selected," implies action. It needs to be removed from evolutionary theory discussion. I'll get into the proper way to think about evolution in a bit, but first an important reason why all of this matters.

So, there's a particular religious movement you might have heard of closely related to evolution, on the middle ground somewhere between creationism and hard-science evolutionary study. Guessed it? It's called Intelligent Design. And I can't think of a better origin story for Intelligent Design than the taking advantage of the misconception of evolution being an active process. Intelligent Design is, of the two it has at it's disposal like Creationism it's the better, Christianity's young explanation for today's life. As the religious groups were dealing with the new science of evolution, they needed to figure out what to do. The more they came to understand the theory, they came to understand the term "natural selection," and where the scientists understand the subtlety of the difference between what they say and what they mean, where they don't literally mean that any selection is taking place, they don't, to this day, build it into the common language, The religious groups decided to simply take it literally and assume there was an agent at the heart of the evolution process making selection decisions, guiding the process. This "active language" of the theory of evolution created the opening for Intelligent Design to make a reasonable stand and start arguing their positions. It's exactly what they needed, they wanted evolution to be directed so that they could say that humans were an intended outcome of evolution and that God was the Intelligent Designer, using evolution to create all of his creation. In the Church's view, Charles Darwin had essentially discovered the method that God had brought his creation from Genesis to the modern day. 


If evolution had been spoken about as it truly is, in a passive way, then there would have been no space for Intelligent Design to create a position and make a movement for itself. Personally, this makes this misconception stand out to me. The misunderstanding is at the level of the public to such a high degree that everyone thinks it and it's plainly the fault of the actual scientists themselves. What's worse, as a result, there's a religious movement spreading misinformation, coupled with the numbers of religious in the world, and they've already got a saturation of subscribers, without even trying. They offer their easily believable fallacies and successfully confuse the public discussion. Intelligent Design as an idea is aims to undermine continuously what real evolutionary biologists are doing with the science by making claims about what they believe was "intended" rather than what the evidence is telling them. They actively campaign their ways of thinking using arguments with regular people on the street that they can't rebuttal, thus getting the people to question they're thinking on the topic and wonder if Intelligent Design philosophy is correct. It's remarkably easy to do, in fact.


They get someone talking and then start questioning them about how to evolve a human eye. The person will, being strong believers in Darwin Evolutionists, think it's obvious. The Host's first, main question (they think this is they're checkmate) is how do you get something so complex and intricate from something so macro and dull like evolution (they think). The person attempts to begin to explain, but approaches it the wrong way, coming at it from a story/evolution of features perspective, and they quickly realize they don't know the inner parts of the human eye all that well, and it's probably a bit more complicated if they did anyway. Couple this with the Intelligent Design Host asking questions every 5 seconds not letting the poor guy get a thought out. Dismantling any attempt he had at building a case. Ultimately the Host convinces that it's impossible to get a human eye, that it's too complex and specifically functional, you would need to design it, that evolution is too random and macro of a process to build something as specific as an eye. And the guy walks away questioning most of his Evolution beliefs. I've seen this supposed turn of beliefs happen in real time. Now, I know, don't believe everything you see on the Internet, the guy could have been a plant, he might have been a believer in Intelligent Design all along. But still it makes you think what's possible. 


Either way, the reality about the human eye is this, so if you're ever approached by anyone of the Intelligent Design flavor and they want you to explain to them how the human eye could have been evolved without a designer, here's your answer. It's rather simple. They claim that the Intelligent Designer is required to add features and put them in the right place. And that evolution can't do that. That's they're claim. We'll welcome to wrong world. Flat wrong world, so there's not much room. It all comes down to mutations. Say we have a population of amoebas with simple light reacting cells, and basically every generation, during reproduction, the genes aren't copied properly and there's a few minor mistakes, just simple chemistry. Nothing special about it. No special reason. Well what you probably never thought about those mutations is that they're basically adding information (complexity, novelty, that eventually become features) into the gene pool. If our genes didn't mutate, the population would just keep passing around the same genes and there would be no new information to evolve anything into. No mutation, no evolution. But anyway, we're injecting information into the population of amoebas and it's very simple set of cells can start gaining more features. Or the population gains two or three different features to it's light reacting cells. Then through the lifetime, some features allowed better survival then others. And then the next generation gets another mutation (read: additional complexity, another feature, especially at the simple cell organism level the growth would be high). With every generation, the complexity is increased.



#


So how did the eye get so complex?


Mutation equals new information in the DNA, so then it's complex simply because of millions of mutations over millions of years.


How does eye get designed without designer?


Some features benefit organism, lives, genes stay in pool: "add"


Some features detriment organism, dies, genes leave pool: "remove"


Add and Remove results are what "design" the eye

#



This is the process to get a complex thing like the eye, and it's completely passive too, it just happens. There was no need for a designer or watchmaker.

So back to our previous discussion about the active or passive nature of Evolution. Evolution has been described here as taking on an active form when in the public forum so that the public understand it to be an active process. In it's most egregious phrasing, as well, it takes on the active voice, which simply compounds the issue, obviously. And additionally we've talked about how this form phrasing has essentially led to a religious movement that without the active voice, would never have had the space to grow roots. So everyone thinks that Evolution is an active process. They think it is a forced mechanism applied to nature in some external sense, like someone somewhere is turning the dials. More importantly, it seems as though, they are waiting around and researching to find a better theory for how species change. 


The reality about Evolution is far more passive, cohesive, significant,  weighty. Evolution is a law of Nature. It's a property of the living system itself. When life is let loose in an organic environment, it can't not happen. When evolutionary biologists talk about selection, they usually know what they mean, and it isn't in the active sense. They're referring to genes surviving into the future of the gene pool, while others have been killed off due to death of organisms who did not have advantageous traits. To them, they're referring to the fact that the traits passed the test posed by the environment, and they're calling it "selection." The language is fine if you understand the science because you always know how to properly interpret it, but it's simply misleading. The truth is not factually different, just the language, and the emphasis, but the meaning changes. In truth, the process is in fact passive. There is no agent at the heart of Evolution. There's a subtly on "action" but I'll get to that in one second. Organisms have traits that either make them fit or unfit for the environment. Those who are unfit, die. Those who are fit, survive and pass on there genes. There is mutation, And there is a propensity of organism's gene's who are fit in future generations. The subtly of action is that death by the environment could be considered an active process on the part of the environment, thereby making Evolution an active process. But the death process is not sentient, so I think it's safe to say that the Evolution process is still passive.  Evolution through the environment is truly more interested in removing organisms from the gene pool, and whatever survives, it doesn't care. This is the heart of the passive nature of Evolution. The survivors are not part of the evolution process, they are literally outside the system. You don't want to be touched by evolution, it usually means you're being selected for death. "Selection" would have been a way more appropriate word for the word that described the death of an organism and removal from the gene pool. It would have an "agent" (Death) right there and ready if any discussion of active/passive came up. There would be no problem having an passive Evolution process and an interpretive active death process called "Selection."
